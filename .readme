Hi I am Nakul Pandit
I made this project with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

<!---> 
My approach for this portfolio website project 
<!--->

My approach was Responsive Design Approach that is I made sure my layouts fits all the screens and mobiles sizes. I have made it to fit from regular screen sizes to even 340 pixels widths screens with the help of media queries in CSS.

The first section of my website contains my brief introduction. It has a button to download my full resume and also direct links to my github, linkedin and email.

The next section is project section in which I have shown my projects and also have implemented an external API to fetch more projects. When the user clicks on title of my project a modal will appear with full details of my project.

The last section is Contact section in which the user can enter his/her details and send response. This contact form is completely validated by javascript to ensure all the details are filled and are in valid structure.
